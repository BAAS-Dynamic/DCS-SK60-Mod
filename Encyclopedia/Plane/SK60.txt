Development of the Saab 105 began in 1959 as a private venture for an aircraft that could be used as trainer, recce and light attack, plus it was also proposed as a 4-5 seat business jet. The swedish Air Force got interested on the type and on December 1961 placed an oorder for 100 units.

The first proptotype flew on June 1963 and on March 1965 the swedish order was increased to 130 aircrafts, to be denominated Saab Sk 60 and built in three versions: Sk 60A for training, Sk 60B for light attack and Sk 60C for attack and recce.

The Sk60A entered service on July 1967. From November 1993, the surviving 115 aircrafts, were updated with a change of engine, its original Turbomeca Aubisque were replaced with Williams FJ44.
